# Motivation

In the process of learning Vue and its ecosystem, i started making a clone of whatsapp. In this clone, i also had an understanding of sockets.

# Description

The WhatsApp clone is made up of a frontend and backend application.

For Frontend, Vue is used along with Vuex.

For Backend, Node.js is used along with Socket.io. You can find the backend project [here](https://github.com/koushik-dev/whatsapp-chat).
